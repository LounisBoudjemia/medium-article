      <p class="main-grey">Picture this: it's 3 AM on a Saturday.
        You're sleeping like a baby when all of sudden a random guy starts screaming with his girlfriend in the middle of your street.

      <p class="main-grey">Thursday 6:45 AM, Tuesday 9 PM or Sunday 6 PM, it's always a good time for drilling and hammering!
        It's not like there's 9 regulars hours during the day and 5 working days that are a better fit.
        This has to happen now because the randomness makes the work more efficient!
        Also, fuck other people.

          There has to be a lower volume setting.
          Do they assume that eveybody in this city is deaf or used to loud noises because they all club too much?
